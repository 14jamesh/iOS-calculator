# iOS-calculator

An iOS 13 calculator that I made for learning DOM interactions. Did the HTML, CSS and obvs the JS.

- Decided to do a mockup of the iOS13 calculator for the design. 
 
- Removed the [+/-], [ . ] and [ % ] functionality for simplicity sake. 
    > My JS works with Math.floor / round --> for this project the focus was on learning DOM interaction - not getting floating point numbers to be as accurate as possible. 

Possible future updates: Strip Math.round/floor and use floating point numbers.
    > Introduce [+/-], [ . ] and [ % ] functionalities.  
   
Lessons learnt: 
 - Event bubbling is useful.
 - Piece-meal approach. 
 - Don't take GUI calculators for granted lol.
