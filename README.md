# iOS-calculator

An iOS 13 calculator that I made for learning DOM interactions. Did the HTML, CSS and obvs the JS.

- Decided to use the iOS13 calculator for my design.
 
- Removed the +/- functionality for simplicity sake, as well as the . functionality.

- My JS works with Math.floor / round --> I was focused on learning DOM interaction, not getting floating point numbers to be as accurate as possible. 

Possible future updates: Strip Math.round/floor and use floating point numbers.
